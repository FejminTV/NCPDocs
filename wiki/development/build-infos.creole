===Next build===
* ...
===3.10.0-RC-b569(**release candidate**)===
* **Planned release on BukkitDev.**
* Hot
** MC/CB 1.6.2 Support.
* fixes
** Metrics: Do start/cancel metrics on reloading as well, not only on startup.
* Internals
** More complete support for the health changes with 1.6.
** Core dependency set to 1.6.2, so older versions suffer some slower compatibility methods rather.

** It is now possible to completely deactivate motd sending for client mods.
** Added hook versions to the output of "ncp info".
** Just in case: To keep the morepackets-vehicle check effective, auto-detection of vehicle events has been added. [Should work, missing: use new events for mount/dismount etc.]
** Just in case: Force close inventories on portal use and world changes, also taking into account riding on entities (on entities...).
* Fixes
** Workarounds added for potential problems with other plugins that don't implement certain compatibility tweaks for the changes in Bukkit from MC 1.5.2 to 1.6.1.
* Internals
** Updated metrics to R7.

* Internal changes
** Add moving (renaming) config paths and deprecated config paths as concepts.
** PlayerData can carry arbitrary tags now.
** Rework commands for easier sub-command adding.

* Release on BukkitDev.
* Add FastConsume check for consuming items (replaces instanteat).
* Fix loading wrong chunks on join/hover checks.
* Few fixes for fastbreak (cocoa / vines, iron/gold blocks)

* Attempt to reduce problems with inventory features (shift+ double click with item in hand).
* Internal changes (some API methods are non-static now).
* Adjust some debug output for nofall/moving.
===3.9.1-RC2-b510(**release**)===
* Release on BukkitDev.

* Login-denial is configurable for illegal-move checking.
* Less strict default settings for chat.logins.
* Fix breaking time for "locked chest".
* Consistency fixes and extensions (fixes some chat checks data not resetting with the remove command).
===3.9.0-RC-b488(**release**)===
* Planned release on BukkitDev.
===3.9.0-b486(cumulative)===
* MC 1.5.1 and 1.5.0 support (blocks + obc/nms-access).\\//This allows players to move into corners of fence-setups also for earlier Minecraft versions.//
* Add basic thorns support (workaround for missing API).
* Fixes for fastbreak with wood-pick + efficiency.
* Might have given jumping on boats slightly more tolerance.
* Consistency fixes (block setup, prevent CB2511 module loading for libigot/no-safeguard-mods).
===3.8.12-RC2-b472(**release**)===
* Release on BukkitDev. [Last minute fixes might follow.]
* Catch on case for ArrayIndexOutOfBounds with InventoryClickEvent.
===3.8.12-RC-b471(planned release)===
* Planned release.
===3.8.12-b470(cumulative)===
* Re-code inventory.fastclick. Likely it is more forgiving on first glance and we might need to add specialized tool/weapon/food checks later, however it allows better control over limits, rudimentary support for some 1.5 inventory issues/features.
* Fix passable ray-tracing not respecting the block-flags.
* Add an example entry for overriding block-flags (doing nothing). Snow levels might not work on 1.4.7 servers with hackish 1.5-protocol support, which can be part-fixed by setting the flags for snow to ground+solid+height_8_inc.
===3.8.11-RC-b467(**release**)===
* Release on BukkitDev. 
===3.8.11-b466(cumulative)===
* Add "blind" MC 1.5 block support. This is an attempt to make 1.5 playable with the bukkit-api-only compatibility module in use. Block breaking times are not adjusted, but the blocks are initialized with some flags for moving over them etc. If a block poses a problem flags can still be overridden using the configuration of NCP.
* Add "ncp unkick *" option to remove all players from the deny-login list.
* Fight.reach distances (survival) are configurable now.
* Add "default" flag option for overriding block flags, for conveniently adding few flags without having to guess the others. More tolerant flag parsing (whitespace), allow '+' for flag-separation as well.
* Consistency fixes for data removal (affects chat.logins for instance).
* Fix godmode being checked for dead players.
* Fix for survivalfly/swimup and stairs.
* Fix "downstream" judgment for horizontal speed not taken into account on second check (after failure).
* Horizontal veloctiy handling:
** Fix wrong counter being used once activated.
** Add maximum tick age for activation. This prevents waiting for a long time without moving before using velocity.
* Use of more exact bounding boxes for the player (mainly survivalfly).
** Reduced the number of blocks visited and deeper checking.
** Various changes to workarounds and other. Could reduce some false positives, could also create new.
** Fixes falling through narrow spots and taking fall damage on some occasions.
* General fixes to block collision logic. Includes changing some flags and workarounds.
* Fixes for block flags with "bukkit-api-only".
* Fixes for MCAccess modules (data cleanup, can't stand on minecarts)
* More performance related changes (moving/survivalfly).
** A little less object creation.
** Re-group some checking and distribute to several methods.
** Collect flags for a smaller bounding box.
** Don't check everything twice if a player does not move.
* Fix: Set the correct potion-effect strength in data.
* Only set velocity flag if velocity is actually being processed (sfDirty).
* Attempt to catch more "lost-ground" cases with block edges.
* Add more detailed tags to lost-ground workarounds (survivalfly) for better debugging.
* Let NoFall look for ground within a slightly extended margin for the case of taking fall damage unexpectedly.
===3.8.11-b452("mostly stable", cumulative)===
* New method of velocity handling for horizontal velocity. The new method uses velocity on demand and allows delayed "activation" to account better for latency.
* Add "strict" option to the fight.direction check. Takes into account not only the distance to the estimated target but also the angle.
* Reduce amount fight.reach can contribute to combined.improbable.
* Fix for non-exact vanilla-respawn.
* Attempt to catch more moved too quickly / moved wrongly teleports in order to prevent resetting of fly-data.
* Further changes and fixes to on-ground judgment.
** More exact judgement if a player can actually stand on/in a block.
** Survivalfly workarounds adjusted to catch more fish.
* Consistency: remove some more data on players leaving.
* Performance related changes (mostly moving / on-ground checks).
===3.8.11-b442(cumulative)===
* Changes to on-ground judgement (ongoing), seems consolidated. Aiming at consistency, performance, spiders. [//amining at//, not yet done/finished!]
* Adaption to debugging messages.
===3.8.10-RC-b438(**release**)===
* Release on BukkitDev.
* Last minute fix: revert removing shortcut on-ground check, but fix it, instead.
===3.8.10-RC-b436(planned release)===
* Scheduled release on BukkitDev [unless for last-minute fixes.]
===3.8.10-b435(release phase, cumulative)===
* Fixes and more safety guards for ray-tracing (general, passable).
* Reduce false positives with SurvivalFly (jumping onto edges, lost-ground, sprint+jump+attack, sneak/block+velocity, jump+sprint+touch-water).
* Add step option to survivalfly/hover, in order to reduce load by only checking every //step// ticks and a loginticks option to allow giving players a little longer hover time after login.
* Adjust some caching for moving checking and remove a --dubious shortcut-- check.
* Fix zombe/noclip permission flipped.
* Fixes for consistency (data removal for chat data, logins data removal in case of "ncp remove *").
* Ensure some blocks like glass or leaves are not ignored by the passable check for bukkit-api-only.
* Added dev-url.
* Add support for the checks.debug flag, as a possibility to set a preset for all checks debug flags.
* Added build-parameter support.

* Add blockinteract.visible (also raytracing for visible blocks, slightly different method).
* Optimize and fix blockinteract checks.
* Add fastheal check.
* Fix direction checks [might need more tweaks against false positives].
* Fixes for survivalfly: standing on sand below cactus, false positives with block edges [not all yet], fix hover check alerting for players who should not get checked after join (flying), false positives with jumping out of water near steps.
* Change configuration of data-expiration: adds an active-flag.
* Add compatibility-option to override any block-flags.
* Add ability to exempt from silent blockplace and blockbreak checks (liquid/air).

* Fix jumping on boats for a part.
* Attempt to fix issues with exiting boats or boats  being destroyed.

* Fixes for consistency (internal components, TickTask, hover check)
* Fix NoFall bypass - partly revert/renew nofall logic for players receiving fall damage though not being on ground.

* Check morepackets(vehicle) for players riding on pigs.
* Adding compatibility block list to be able to allow "instant breaking" for those blocks, in case a block type poses trouble with fastbreak.

* Add fine grained permissions for Rei's Minimap's radar.
===3.8.9-b319 (cumulative)===
* **Support for Minecraft 1.4.7.**

* Should have fixed issues with fall damage dealt and death-message plugins.
===3.8.9-b316 (cumulative)===

* Slight changes to NoFall: Remove "double damage", also having in mind the case of Minecraft dealing false damage.
* Add// /ncp unexempt *//
* Update Metrics.
* Remove old LagMeasureTask in favor of the new TickTask.

* Fixes for "System time ran backwards". 
===3.8.9-b311 (cumulative)===
* **Seems to have fixed or worked around issues with /spawn and Essentials.**
* Internal changes to keep set-backs "firewalled" against locations coming from outside (//Still not sure what the actual cause was, suspicion is other plugins messing with special objects that behave strangely on cloning and are kept as references somehow, but that is more like an uneducated guess.//). Leads to less object creation from moving checks (unless for set-backs).
===3.8.8-b310 (cumulative)===
* **Incompatibility with Essentials, MultiVerse, MobArena**\\Their spawn locations //seems// to change after some time, does not appear to happen with simple plugins that use the worlds spawn.
* Adjustments to set-backs for moving checks. \\//(See incompatibility note above)//\\Setting the set backs will use less object creation, getting them will create objects rather.
* Add some lag-awareness, i.e. counting in lag durations or skipping short term checks.

===3.8.8-b301 (beta release, cumulative )===
* Beta release on BukkitDev.
* Adaptions and fixes to combined.yawrate and combined.improbable.
* Add "strict" flag to the configuration of blockbreak.fastbreak. Similar to inventory.instantbow, setting this to false will lead to taking the time between two block break actions, not from interaction to breaking.

* Add kicklist and unkick commands.
===3.7.0-b91 (cumulative)===
* Only add defaults to world configs, that belong there, warn if entries are present that only should or only can be set in the global configuration file.
* Fix world configs not being recognized.
===3.7.0-b88 (cumulative)===
* Mostly fixes for fastbreak (important).
* Add level to wrong block check, and let it trigger much less often.
* Improvements for commands (remove removes also history, works for data of players that went offline).
===--3.7.0-b86-- (cumulative, feature complete)===
* (b86) Important fixes for fastbreak.
* Reorganize fast breaking: fastbreak will be the new check, blockbreak.frequency will be the check limiting the breaking frequency even for insta breaking.
* Allow creative to insta break.
* Allow insta break leaves with efficiency>1, adjust durationfor leaves for efficiency 1.
* Contains a more exact fast break check, taking into account individual blocks and enchantments. Needs further testing.
* Improvement for wrong-blobk check.
* Might need more balancing, reports about blocks/tools/enhantments combinations conflicting with fastbreak most welcome (//only if oldcheck is set to false...//)!
===3.7.0-b82 (**beta candidate**)===
* Violation level of wrong-block check decreases with time now.
* Added internals for better fast break checks (few difference).
===--3.7.0-b81--===
* Simplify and optimize violation handling and actions execution (small bug probability).
* Adjust KnockBack check to only count start of sprinting, not end of sprinting.
===--3.7.0-b80-- (cumulative)===
* Add command "ncp removeplayer", to remove player violation data. The globalchat engine datas (holding typed words etc.) will not be reset by this, but that expires after about 30 seconds anyway.
* Add "wrong block" check (block break).
* Add "improbable" check (combined: several indications of improbable behavior, like speeds, hitting on max distance, other violations).
* Add "ncp tempkick [player] [minutes]..."\\//(Denies login, does not save kicked players.)//
===--3.7.0-b78-- ===
* Fix check type not displaying correctly on ncp info.
===--3.7.0-b77-- (cumulative)===
**Consider --Builds 73 to 76 broken!-- use 77 up.**
* Critical fix over --73 to 76--: Actions endless repetition.
* Important fix: blockbreak / fastbreak.
* Fix: range for globalchat/similarity is now read from the config.
* Chat updates players permission states on world changes.
* Rework asynchronous actions execution handling - demands of hooks for chat to allow processing in another thread than the main thread.
* Tweak nofall (less extra on-ground checking).
* Make tolerance for step check configurable, defaulting to 0.1: checks.moving.survivalfly.ystep  -  maximally close to below 0.5, players moving up for 1 +- tolerance get reset (in short).
===--3.7.0-b72--===
* Update permissions in plugin.yml
===--3.7.0-b71-- (cumulative)===
* Add: selfhit check.
* Fix: Global config does not overwrite on reading errors.
* nomovedtooquickly settings are hidden now (too much confusion with versions / 1.3.1 servers with 1.3.2 clients etc.)
* globalchat: add hidden active flags for global and player sections (work in per world configs).
* Remove ban/ip actions from nopwnage checks default actions.
* All kick commands done from chat checks should use delayed kicks (dafaults adjusted: ncp delay ...).
===--3.7.0-b68--===
* globalchat
** Renaming of the engine config section. global/player: words, prefixes.\\**Removes the engine section, and engine.active setting**\\The extended checks have to be activated individually , global and per player method sections can have a weight to be multiplied with the results, further settings available. By default all are turned off.
** nopwnage.debug/globlachat.debug: true outputs scoring info to the console.
** globalchat.maximum: false Will sum up engine scores instead of using the maximum.
** Adding a similarity check.
* Fixes. Nopwnage vl accumulates now correctly.
* captcha: Removed some letters from the defaults.
===--3.7.0-b67--===
* Important fix for glcompressedwords (only relevant if enabled).
* Potential fixes for startup issues.
===--3.7.0-b66--===
* nopwnage.speed.weight: 100
* globalchat.level: 80
* globalchat.engine.active: false
* globalchat.engine.glcompressedwords.active: false
\\//Reloading resets chat violation data, now.//
