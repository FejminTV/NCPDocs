Points about testing and testers (based on an answer to a pm).

Testing is always welcome!

Two basic things that already help a lot:
* Report any bugs or strange things that might be related to NCP.
* Test development versions (http://www.nocheatplus.org:8080/job/NoCheatPlus/changes), for "real" or production servers be minimally careful and check the changes since last build that you used or ask which version is safe to "test".

Extended testing could be:
* Try to check if features claimed to be implemented in dev versions really work.
* Try to reproduce problems mentioned in tickets or on the main page and report back if reproduced or ask for more details on how to, according to given info in tickets etc..
* Test new features of hack clients with the development versions.
* Report potential exploits and bugs for Minecraft / CB that we might fix with NCP.
* Test what i ask to test.

The extended stuff would be what an official team-member-tester would do for some part. On the other hand the two things on the top can already help a great lot (false positives, effects of live-server use, performance issues...).
